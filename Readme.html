This gimmick recreates the FNAF mode in which the player must survive for a period of time
(12AM to 6AM) in order to finish the level (not necessary ending the level, it teleports
the player out of the &ldquo;FNAF levels&rdquo;).<br><br>

<b>Note:</b> I highly recommend have at least some experience with ASM due to the stabilizability
being complex, and that you'll likely have to make changes to this. It features viewing other levels,
layer 3 map interface, and more.<br><br>

What you need:
<ul>
<li>[Tool] <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=17500">Gopher Popcorn stew</a></li>
<li>[Tool] <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=16540">Uberasm tool</a></li>
<li>[Custom Block] <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=18347">Controller Execute Once blocks</a></li>
</ul><br><br>

I did include a sample level and other pre-done &ldquo;assets&rdquo; to get an idea on how this works. Key facts:
<ul>
<li><b>Timer:</b> A simple 16-bit frame counter that increments. Hits a certain value, and teleports the player to a
specific level. This is run by Uberasm tool code.</li><br>

<li><b>Power:</b>A 24-bit (3 bytes) value that decrements. Note that this is a fixed-point value; Byte 0 is a fraction out
of 256, and the other two are the values to be read, therefore its <tt>$xxxx.xx</tt>.</li><br>


</ul>
